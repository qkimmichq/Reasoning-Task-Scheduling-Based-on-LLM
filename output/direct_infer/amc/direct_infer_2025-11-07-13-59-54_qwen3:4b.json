        "infer_answer": "To determine how many miles from City $ A $ Alicia and Beth will be when they meet, we analyze their motion as follows:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Setup**\n\n- Cities $ A $ and $ B $ are **45 miles apart**.\n- Alicia starts at city $ A $ and bikes toward $ B $ at **18 mph**.\n- Beth starts at city $ B $ and bikes toward $ A $ at **12 mph**.\n- They leave at the **same time**.\n\nWe are to find the **distance from city $ A $** where they meet.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Time Until They Meet**\n\nSince they are moving **toward each other**, their **relative speed** is the sum of their individual speeds:\n\n$$\n\\text{Relative speed} = 18 \\text{ mph} + 12 \\text{ mph} = 30 \\text{ mph}\n$$\n\nThe total distance between them is **45 miles**, so the time it takes for them to meet is:\n\n$$\nt = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Relative Speed}} = \\frac{45}{30} = 1.5 \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate Distance from City $ A $ When They Meet**\n\nAlicia has been biking for 1.5 hours at 18 mph. The distance she covers in that time is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Distance from } A = 18 \\times 1.5 = 27 \\text{ miles}\n$$\n\nThis means that **they meet 27 miles from city $ A $**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verification (Optional but Helpful)**\n\nBeth also travels for 1.5 hours at 12 mph:\n\n$$\n\\text{Distance from } B = 12 \\times 1.5 = 18 \\text{ miles}\n$$\n\nSo, they meet **27 miles from $ A $** and **18 miles from $ B $**, which adds up to 45 miles — confirming the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{27}\n$$",

So the **total cost** becomes:\n  $$\n  \\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Discounted Price} + (\\text{Tax on Discounted Price}) = 0.8P + (0.075 \\times 0.8P)\n  $$\n\n- Simplify:\n  $$\n  \\text{Total Cost} = 0.8P \\times (1 + 0.075) = 0.8P \\times 1.075 = 0.86P\n  $$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Budget Constraint\n\nCarlos has **$43** to spend. Therefore, the total cost must be **less than or equal to $43**:\n\n$$\n0.86P \\leq 43\n$$\n\nSolving for $ P $:\n\n$$\nP \\leq \\frac{43}{0.86}\n$$\n\nNow compute:\n\n$$\n\\frac{43}{0.86} = 50\n$$\n\nSo the **maximum original price** Carlos can afford is **$50**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Calculation\n\nLet’s verify that a $50 original price results in exactly $43 total cost:\n\n- Discounted price: $ 50 \\times 0.8 = 40 $\n- Sales tax: $ 40 \\times 0.075 = 3 $\n- Total cost: $ 40 + 3 = 43 $\n\n✅ This matches Carlos's budget exactly.\n\nIf the original price were **more than $50**, the total cost would exceed $43, which is not affordable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{50}\n$$",
