        "infer_answer": "Let's break this problem down step by step!\n\n1. Let's find the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet:\n\nDistance = Rate × Time\n45 miles (distance between cities) = 18 mph (Alicia's rate) × t + 12 mph (Beth's rate) × t\n\nCombine like terms:\n45 miles = 30 mph × t\n\nNow, solve for time:\nt = 45 miles / 30 mph = 1.5 hours\n\n2. Since Alicia bikes at 18 mph and Beth bikes at 12 mph, the combined distance they cover in 1 hour is:\n\nCombined rate = 18 mph + 12 mph = 30 mph\nDistance covered in 1 hour = Combined rate × Time = 30 mph × 1.5 hours = 45 miles\n\nThis means that Alicia and Beth will be 0 miles from City A when they meet, since they cover the entire distance of 45 miles.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{0}",

The total number of games played is equal to the number of ways to choose 2 people from a group of $n$ people, which is:\n\n$$\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$\n\nNow, let's analyze the number of games won by left-handed players. Since there are $L$ left-handed players and each player plays every other participant exactly once, the number of games won by left-handed players is:\n\n$$\\text{Games won by LHP} = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot L\\cdot (n-L)$$\n\nSimilarly, the number of games won by right-handed players is:\n\n$$\\text{Games won by RHP} = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot R\\cdot (n-R)$$\n\nWe are given that the number of games won by left-handed players is $40\\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players.

We can see that:\n\n* The first row has only one entry, which is 1.\n* The second row has two entries: 1 and 1. The sum of these diagonals is 2, so the interior entry is 3 (since 1 + 2 = 3).\n* The third row has three entries: 1, 3, and 1.

The sum of the diagonals is 11, so the interior entries are 7, 11, 7, and 1 (since 1 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 12).

        "infer_answer": "Let's break this problem down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the regular icosahedron. It has 12 vertices of degree 3 (i.e., each vertex is connected to three other vertices) and 20 edges.

There are $\\binom{12}{3} = 220$ ways to choose three distinct vertices from the 12.\n\nNext, let's consider the possible values of $d(Q,R)$ and $d(R,S)$. Since $d(A,B)$ is the minimum number of edges needed to connect two vertices, it can only take integer values between 1 (if $\\overline{QR}$ or $\\overline{RS}$ is an edge) and 3 (if none of the three edges $\\overline{QR}$, $\\overline{QS}$, and $\\overline{RS}$ are edges).\n\nWe want to find the probability that $d(Q,R)>d(R,S)$. This means we need to count the number of ways this inequality can happen.\n\nLet's consider the possible values of $d(Q,R)$:\n\n* If $d(Q,R)=1$, then $\\overline{QR}$ is an edge, and $Q$ and $R$ are connected. In this case, $d(R,S)\\leq2$, since we need at most two edges to connect $R$ to $S$.\n* If $d(Q,R)=2$, then there's no edge between $Q$ and $R$, but there's an edge connecting one of them to a third vertex. In this case, $d(R,S)\\leq3$, since we need at most three edges to connect $R$ to $S$.\n\nNow, let's count the number of ways $d(Q,R)>d(R,S)$ can happen:\n\n* If $d(Q,R)=1$, then $d(R,S)=1$. This happens when $\\overline{RS}$ is an edge. There are 12 such cases.\n* If $d(Q,R)=2$, then $d(R,S)=1$ or $2$. This happens when there's no edge between $R$ and $S$, but one of them is connected to a third vertex. There are 24 such cases (6 for each possible value of $d(R,S)$).\n* If $d(Q,R)=3$, then $d(R,S)=1$, 2, or 3. This happens when none of the three edges $\\overline{QR}$, $\\overline{QS}$, and $\\overline{RS}$ are edges. There are 24 such cases (8 for each possible value of $d(R,S)$).\n\nIn total, there are $12+24+24=60$ ways to choose $Q$, $R$, and $S$ such that $d(Q,R)>d(R,S)$.

The equation $\\sum_{d\\mid n}d\\cdot f\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)=1$ defines the function $f$ on positive integers.\n2. We want to find $f(2023)$, so let's start by analyzing the equation for small values of $n$.\n\nFor $n=1$, we have $\\sum_{d\\mid 1}d\\cdot f(1) = 1 \\Rightarrow f(1) = 1$.\n\nFor $n=2$, we have $\\sum_{d\\mid 2}d\\cdot f(1) = 1 \\Rightarrow f(1) = 1/2$ (since the only divisors of 2 are 1 and 2).\n\nFor $n=3$, we have $\\sum_{d\\mid 3}d\\cdot f(1) = 1 \\Rightarrow f(1) = 1/3$.\n\nNotice a pattern? The sum is always equal to 1, and the function values seem to be reciprocals of the divisors. Let's formalize this:\n\n3. Suppose $n=p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ is the prime factorization of $n$, where $p_i$ are distinct primes and $e_i\\ge 0$. Then, the divisors of $n$ are all products of the form $\\prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{d_i}$, where $0\\le d_i\\le e_i$.\n\n4. For each divisor $d=\\prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{d_i}$, we have $f(n/d)=f(\\prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{e_i-d_i})$. Since the prime factorization of $n/d$ has fewer factors than that of $n$, we can apply the same reasoning recursively.\n\n5. In particular, for any positive integer $m$, if $d\\mid m$ and $f(m/d)=1/m$, then $\\sum_{e\\mid d} e\\cdot f(m/e) = 1/m$. This is because the sum only includes divisors of $d$, so we can \"cancel out\" the common factors.\n\n6.

Now, let's consider the coefficient of $\\tan^{2023}x$:\n\n$$a_{2023} \\tan^{2023}x = \\tan(x)$$\n\n12. Since this equation holds for all $x$, we can equate the coefficients of $\\tan^{2023}x$ on both sides:\n\n$$a_{2023} = 1$$\n\nTherefore, our final answer is:\n\n$$\\boxed{a_{2023}=1}$$",

First, we need to find the largest perfect square that is less than 2023.\nTo do this, we can start with the square of the integer closest to $\\sqrt{2023}$.\n\n$\\sqrt{2023} \\approx 45$, so let's try $44^2 = 1936$. This is too big, but it gives us a hint that the perfect square we're looking for might be around $40^2$ or smaller.\n\nLet's try $39^2 = 1521$. This is still too big, but we're getting closer. Trying $38^2 = 1444$, which is also too big. However, $37^2 = 1369$, which is still a bit too big.\n\nAh-ha! Let's try $36^2 = 1296$, which is just a bit too small. This means our perfect square must be between $1296$ and $1444$. The only perfect squares in this range are $36^2, 35^2, \\ldots, 5^2, 4^2$.\n\n2. Now that we know the largest perfect square less than 2023 is $36^2 = 1296$, let's find the smallest positive perfect square that is divisible by 5.\nThe first few perfect squares are: $1^2 = 1$, $2^2 = 4$, $3^2 = 9$, $4^2 = 16$, and $5^2 = 25$.\n\nNotice that $5^2 = 25$ is the smallest perfect square divisible by 5. Since we're looking for positive perfect squares less than 2023, our answer will be all the integers between $25$ (inclusive) and $1296$ (exclusive) that are perfect squares.\n\n3. Let's count these perfect squares:\n\n* $25$\n* $36^2 = 1296$ (too big)\n* $5^2 = 25$ (already counted)\n\nThe only other perfect square in this range is $6^2 = 36$, which we already excluded because it's too big.\n\nSo, there are $\\boxed{1}$ positive perfect squares less than 2023 that are divisible by 5.",

She keeps a running total of the numbers she rolls. This means that after each roll, she adds the new number to the previous total.\n3. We want to find the probability that at some point, her running total will equal 3.\n\nLet's analyze the possible ways Janet can get a running total of 3:\n\n* She could roll a 1 on one die and then roll a 2 on another die, making her total 3.\n* She could roll a 2 on one die and then roll a 1 on another die, also making her total 3.\n* She could roll a 3 on one die (this is the easiest case!).\n\nNow, let's count the number of ways Janet can get a running total of 3:\n\n* Case 1: Roll a 1 and then a 2. There are 6 choices for the first die (any number from 1 to 6) and 5 choices for the second die (since it can't be a 1). So, there are 6 × 5 = 30 ways Janet can roll a 1 followed by a 2.\n* Case 2: Roll a 2 and then a 1. There are also 6 × 5 = 30 ways Janet can roll a 2 followed by a 1.\n* Case 3: Roll a 3 directly.

The midpoint of AB has coordinates (6, 2). This means that the average x-coordinate of A and B is 6:\n(1/2)(x_A + x_B) = 6\n3. Since we know the midpoint's y-coordinate is 2, we can write an equation for the line segment AB:\ny = (2 - 0)/(6 - 1) = (2)/5\n4. Now, let's use the fact that points A and B lie on the graph of y = log2x to relate their x-coordinates to their y-coordinates:\nlog2(x_A) = 2\nlog2(x_B) = 0\n5. Since we know the equation of the line segment AB (y = (2)/5), we can substitute the expressions for y from steps 4 into this equation and solve for x:\n(2)/5 = log2(x_A)\n= log2(x_B) + 2\n6. Simplify the equation in step 5:\n(1/5) = log2(x_B) / (log2(2))\n7. Multiply both sides by log2(2):\n(1/5)(log2(2)) = x_B\n8.

The date within the month also has 2 digits, so it can be any integer from 01 to 28 (since there are at most 28 days in a month).\n4. We want to find out how many dates in 2023 will have each digit appear an even number of times.\n\nLet's analyze the possible values for each digit:\n\n* Year: The year is fixed as 2023, so we don't need to consider this further.\n* Month:\n\t+ If the month is 02 (February), then the date can be any integer from 01 to 28. This means that all digits except 0 and 2 will appear an odd number of times.\n\t+ If the month is not 02, then it must be either 04, 06, 08, ..., or 12. In this case, the date can be any integer from 01 to 30 (since there are at most 30 days in these months).

However, for one of these dates (28), the digit 2 appears twice.

The new mean will be (xx + 11) / (number of quizzes + 1). Since this mean increases by 1, we can set up the equation:\n\n(xx + 11) / (number of quizzes + 1) = x + 1\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nxx + 11 = (x + 1)(number of quizzes + 1)\n\nExpanding the right-hand side, we have:\n\nxx + 11 = x(number of quizzes + 1) + 1\n\nNow, let's consider what happens if Maureen scores an 11 on each of the next three quizzes.

This is because the center of the circle is at (2,0), and the distance from the center to any point on the circle is 4.\n\n2. Since the circle with radius 10 has center on the positive y-axis and is tangent to the x-axis at the origin, its equation must be x^2+(y-5)^2=100. This is because the center of the circle is at (0,5), and the distance from the center to any point on the circle is 10.\n\n3. The two circles intersect when their equations are equal. We can set up an equation by equating the two expressions:\n\n(x-2)^2+y^2=16\nx^2+(y-5)^2=100\n\n4. Simplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx^2-4x+4+y^2=y^2-10y+25=100\n\n5.

        "infer_answer": "Let's break this down step by step!\n\n1. Let the length of one base be x. Since the other base is twice as long, it would be 2x.\n2. The area of an isosceles trapezoid can be calculated using the formula: Area = (average width) × height\n3. The average width is the sum of the two bases divided by 2: (x + 2x)/2 = 3x/2\n4. The height is the length of one leg, which is 1.\n5. Plug in the values into the formula: Area = (3x/2) × 1 = 3x/2\n6. Now we need to maximize this area. Since x is the length of a base, it must be positive. So, let's take the derivative of the area with respect to x and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(3x/2)/dx = 0\n\nThis gives us: 3/2 = 0 (which doesn't make sense)\n\nWait, what? This is not a maximum! It seems we have a problem.\n\n7. Ah, but there's another way to approach this. Since the area is proportional to x, and x is positive, the maximum area will occur when x is as large as possible. In other words, we want to maximize x.\n8. Recall that one base is twice as long as the other (x). So, if we make x as large as possible, we'll get a larger area.\n9. The largest value of x would be when it equals 2(1) = 2.

Let's consider each case separately:\n\n* **Horizontal orientation**: The rectangle covers two adjacent squares in a row (e.g., squares 1-2, 2-3, or 1-3).\n* **Vertical orientation**: The rectangle covers two adjacent squares in a column (e.g., squares 1-1, 2-2, or 3-3).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the most informative guesses**\nTo minimize the number of turns needed, we want to make informed guesses that maximize our chances of finding at least one covered square. Let's focus on the first turn.\n\n* **Turn 1**: Guess a square in the middle row (row 2).
