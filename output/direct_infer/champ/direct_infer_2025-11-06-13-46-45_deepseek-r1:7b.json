For \\( n = 3 \\), we have three 1s: 1 + 1 + 1, and there are two gaps where we can insert plus signs, leading to \\( 2^2 = 4 \\) compositions.\n\nIn general, for any positive integer \\( n \\), the number of sequences (compositions) is equal to the number of ways we can insert plus signs into the string of \\( n \\) ones.
