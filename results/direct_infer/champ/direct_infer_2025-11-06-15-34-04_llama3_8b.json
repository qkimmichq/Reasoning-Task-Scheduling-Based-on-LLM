      "question": "Let a string consist of digit 1, 2, 3. How many such strings of length 6 have adjacent digit differing by less than or equal to 1?",
      "infer_answer": "Let's break this problem down step by step!\n\nWe want to find the number of strings of length 6 that have adjacent digits differing by less than or equal to 1.\n\nLet's start by considering a single pair of adjacent digits. There are three possibilities for the first digit (1, 2, or 3). For each of these possibilities, there are two possible values for the second digit: either the same as the first digit or differing from it by at most 1.\n\nFor example, if the first digit is 1, the second digit could be:\n\n* The same: 11\n* Differing by 1: 12 or 13\n\nSimilarly, if the first digit is 2, the second digit could be:\n\n* The same: 22\n* Differing by 1: 21, 23\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, let's consider a string of length 6. We can think of it as a sequence of pairs of adjacent digits. For each pair, we have two possibilities (same or differing by at most 1). Therefore, the total number of possible strings is:\n\n2 (possibilities for first digit) × 2 (possibilities for second digit) = 4\n\nFor each string, there are four possibilities for the next pair of adjacent digits. So, the total number of possible strings is:\n\n4 (previous possibilities) × 4 (next possibilities) = 16\n\nHowever, this overcounts the number of strings because some strings have repeated pairs or consecutive identical digits. For example, \"111\" has three consecutive 1s and should be counted only once.\n\nTo account for these duplicates, we need to divide our total count by the number of ways to arrange a single pair of adjacent digits (2). This gives us:\n\n16 ÷ 2 = 8\n\nSo, there are 8 strings of length 6 that have adjacent digits differing by less than or equal to 1.\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{8}",

      "question": "How many strings of length 5 using the digits {0, 1, ..., 9} (with leading zeros allowed) have strictly increasing digits?",
      "infer_answer": "Let's break this problem down step by step:\n\n1. The first digit can be any number from 0 to 9, so there are 10 possibilities.\n\n2. For the second digit, it must be greater than the first digit. Since we're allowing leading zeros, the smallest possible value for the second digit is 1 (since the first digit could be 0). Therefore, the second digit can be any number from 1 to 9, so there are 9 possibilities.\n\n3. For the third digit, it must be greater than the second digit. Again, since we're allowing leading zeros, the smallest possible value for the third digit is 2 (since the first two digits could be 01). Therefore, the third digit can be any number from 2 to 9, so there are 8 possibilities.\n\n4. For the fourth digit, it must be greater than the third digit. Again, since we're allowing leading zeros, the smallest possible value for the fourth digit is 3 (since the first three digits could be 012). Therefore, the fourth digit can be any number from 3 to 9, so there are 7 possibilities.\n\n5. For the fifth and final digit, it must be greater than the fourth digit. Since we're allowing leading zeros, the smallest possible value for the fifth digit is 4 (since the first four digits could be 0123). Therefore, the fifth digit can be any number from 4 to 9, so there are 6 possibilities.\n\nNow that we've counted the possibilities for each digit, we multiply them together:\n\n10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 = 30,240\n\nHowever, this includes strings with leading zeros (e.g., \"00012\"), which are not strictly increasing. To account for these, we need to subtract the number of strings that start with a zero and have only one or two digits:\n\n10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 5 = 21,600\n\nFinally, we add back in the strings that start with a zero and have three or more digits:\n\n30,240 - 21,600 + (10 × 9 × 8 × 7) = 30,240 - 14,040 + 4,320 = 20,520\n\nSo, there are \\boxed{20520} strings of length 5 using the digits {0, 1, ..., 9} that have strictly increasing digits.",

      "infer_answer": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. We want to place n rooks on an n x n chess board such that no two rooks are on the same row or column.\n2. Since the placement is invariant to a 180-degree rotation, we can assume without loss of generality that all rooks are placed in the top-left quadrant of the board (i.e., rows 1 to n and columns 1 to n).\n3. For each rook, there are n possible positions on the board (n choices for row and n choices for column). So, the total number of ways to place one rook is n^2.\n4. Now, consider two rooks. We want to avoid placing them on the same row or column. This means that we can't place a rook in a position where another rook has already been placed.\n5.

Next, let's count the number of subsets that do not contain any of the numbers 1-10. There are 2^10 = 1024 such subsets (since each subset can have either 0 or 1 elements).\n3. Now, let's count the number of subsets that contain some but not all of the numbers 1-10. We'll do this by counting the number of ways to choose which numbers to include.\n\t* For any given subset, we can choose whether to include each number (1, 2, ..., 10) or not.

We can start by considering the first child's position. There are 11 possibilities for where the first child can sit.\n4. Now, let's focus on the second child. Since each child can move by at most one seat, the second child can only sit in one of two positions: either immediately next to the first child or one seat away from the first child.\n5.

To do this, let's first consider a specific subset T in S.\n\nLet k be an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Then, the set {k} is a subset of {1, 2,..., n}. The product P({k}) of the reciprocals of its elements is simply 1/k.\n\nNow, let's consider all subsets T in S that contain k. These are precisely the sets that have k as an element.

Since the tiling needs to be the same when the rectangle is flipped around the middle column, that means the left half of the rectangle (from column 1 to 10) will have the same pattern as the right half (from column 11 to 21).\n\nLet's focus on the left half first. We can think of it as a sequence of 2x1 tiles that repeats itself every 5 columns. This is because there are 20 columns in total, and we need to divide them into groups of 5 to ensure the tiling pattern is preserved when flipped.\n\nThe sequence starts with two 2x1 tiles (A), followed by three more 2x1 tiles (B), then another two 2x1 tiles (C), and so on. The pattern looks like this:\n\n... A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U ...\n\nSince the sequence repeats every 5 columns, we can write it as a string of length 10: \"ABCD...\". This means that the left half of the rectangle will have a pattern of 10 elements.\n\nNow, let's look at the right half. Since it needs to be the same when flipped, it must also have the same pattern as the left half. Therefore, we can write the sequence for the right half as the reverse of the sequence for the left half:\n\n... U T S R Q P O N M L K J I H G F E D C B A ...\n\nNotice that this is just the original sequence \"ABCD...\" spelled backwards.\n\nSince both halves have the same pattern, we can fill the entire rectangle by repeating the 10-element sequence twice. The number of ways to do this is simply the number of possible sequences of length 10, which is:\n\n2^10 = 1024\n\nHowever, not all these sequences will result in a valid tiling. For example, if the sequence starts with \"A\" and then has only \"B\"s for the next few elements, it won't work.\n\nTo count the number of valid tilings, we need to consider the possible combinations of 2x1 tiles that can be used to fill each column. Since there are two options (either a 2x1 tile or no tile) for each column, the total number of combinations is:\n\n2^21 = 2,048\n\nNow, we need to subtract the invalid tilings from this total. To do this, let's think about what makes a tiling invalid. It's when the sequence \"ABCD...\" is not repeated correctly in both halves.\n\nFor example, if the left half has the pattern \"A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U ...\" and the right half has the pattern \"... U T S R Q P O N M L K J I H G F E D C B A\", it's not a valid tiling because the sequence is not repeated correctly.\n\nTo count the number of invalid tilings, we can think about what makes them different from the valid ones. It's when the left half has a pattern that doesn't match the reversed pattern in the right half. Since there are 10 elements in each half, there are 2^10 = 1024 possible patterns for each half.\n\nHowever, not all these patterns will result in an invalid tiling. For example, if the left half has the pattern \"A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U ...\" and the right half has the same pattern, it's a valid tiling!\n\nTo count the number of invalid tilings, we need to subtract the valid ones from the total. This means that:\n\n2^21 - 1024 = 2020\n\nSo, there are 2020 invalid tilings.\n\nFinally, we can find the number of valid tilings by subtracting the number of invalid tilings from the total:\n\n2,048 - 2020 = 28\n\nTherefore, there are \\boxed{28} ways to fill a 2x21 rectangle with 2x1 tiles such that the tiling is the same when the rectangle is flipped around the middle column.",

      "question": "Let A be a string of n binary digits (leading 0s are allowed). How many such strings have the substring \"01\" appearing exactly m times, as an expression of m and n?",
      "infer_answer": "A nice problem!\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We want to find the number of strings with exactly $m$ occurrences of the substring \"01\".\n2. For each occurrence of \"01\", we have two possibilities: either \"0\" or \"1\" can come before it, and then \"1\" must come after it.\n3. So, for each occurrence of \"01\", we have 2 choices (0 or 1) for the first digit, and then 1 choice (1) for the second digit.\n4. Therefore, for each occurrence of \"01\", we have a total of $2 \\cdot 1 = 2$ possibilities.\n5. Since there are $m$ occurrences of \"01\", we multiply the number of possibilities by $2^m$: $(2)^m$\n6. Now, consider the remaining part of the string (after all \"01\" substrings have been placed). This part can be any binary string with length $n - 2m$, since each \"01\" substring takes up 2 characters.\n7. For this remaining part, we have 2 choices for each character (0 or 1), so there are a total of $2^{n-2m}$ possible strings.\n8. Finally, to get the total number of strings with exactly $m$ occurrences of \"01\", we multiply the number of possibilities for the \"01\" substrings by the number of possibilities for the remaining part: $(2)^m \\cdot 2^{n-2m} = 2^m \\cdot 2^{n-2m}$\n\nSo, our final answer is:\n\n$$\\boxed{2^m \\cdot 2^{n-2m}}$$",

      "question": "Does a polyhedron exists with an odd number of faces, each face having an odd number of edges?",
      "infer_answer": "Let's break this down step by step!\n\n1. A polyhedron has a finite number of faces.\n2. Each face is a polygon (a closed shape made up of line segments).\n3. A polygon with an odd number of sides is called an odd-sided polygon.\n4. An odd-sided polygon must have at least 3 sides, since the minimum number of sides for a polygon is 3.\n5. For an odd-sided polygon to exist, it must be possible to draw a closed shape with an odd number of line segments (edges) that do not intersect each other.\n6. Now, consider a single edge of this odd-sided polygon. This edge has two endpoints, and since the polygon has an odd number of sides, one endpoint is shared by only one side, while the other endpoint is shared by another side.\n7. Since there are an odd number of edges, at least one edge must have both its endpoints shared by only one side (otherwise, we would have an even number of edges).\n8. This means that this particular edge has no \"partner\" edge on the opposite side of the polygon, since it is not shared by another side.\n9. Now, imagine drawing a line segment from the midpoint of this edge to the center of the polyhedron (if we assume the polyhedron is convex).\n10. This line segment would intersect exactly one face of the polyhedron, which means that face must have an even number of edges, since it shares at least one edge with another face.\n11. But wait! We started with a face having an odd number of edges. This contradicts our previous conclusion in step 10.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that no polyhedron exists with an odd number of faces, each face having an odd number of edges.",

      "question": "How many different ordered triples (a, b, c) of non-negative integers are there such that a+b+c=99?",
      "infer_answer": "Let's break this problem down step by step!\n\n1. Since a, b, and c are non-negative integers, we can start by considering the possible values of a.\n2. The maximum value of a is 99, since a + b + c = 99. However, if a = 99, then b and c would have to be 0, which doesn't give us many options for different triples.\n3. So, let's consider smaller values of a. If a = 98, then b and c would have to be 1, which still leaves limited possibilities for different triples.\n4. If we set a = 97, then b and c could be 2, giving us some more options.\n\nAt this point, it might be helpful to visualize the possible values of a, b, and c:\n\n| a | b | c |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0-1 | 98-99 | 0-1 |\n| 2-3 | 96-98 | 0-1 |\n| 4-5 | 94-96 | 0-1 |\n| ... | ... | ... |\n\nAs you can see, the possibilities start to get more interesting as a gets smaller.\n\n5. To find the number of different ordered triples, we need to count the number of possible values for each variable (a, b, and c) and multiply them together.\n6. For a, there are 98 possible values (since a ≤ 99).\n7. For b, given that a is fixed, there are 100 - a possible values (since b ≤ 99 - a).\n8. For c, given that a and b are fixed, there is one value left (since c = 99 - a - b).\n\nNow, let's multiply the number of possible values for each variable:\n\n98 × 100-a × 1 = 9800 - 98a\n\nThis expression gives us the total number of different ordered triples.\n\nHowever, we need to find the number of solutions that satisfy the condition a + b + c = 99. To do this, we can set up an inequality and solve for a:\n\na ≤ 99 - (b + c)\n\nSince a is non-negative, we know that a ≥ 0. Substituting this into our inequality, we get:\n\n0 ≤ 99 - (b + c)\n\nSimplifying the inequality, we get:\n\nb + c ≤ 99\n\nThis means that b and c can take on any value from 0 to 98.\n\nNow, let's use the formula for combinations with repetition:\n\nC(n+r-1, r-1) = C(98+2-1, 2-1) = C(99, 1) = 100\n\nThis gives us the number of possible solutions that satisfy the condition a + b + c = 99.\n\nFinally, let's multiply this result by the total number of different ordered triples:\n\n9800 - 98a × 100 = 9800000\n\nHowever, we're not done yet! We need to find the number of solutions that actually correspond to different ordered triples. To do this, we can use the formula for combinations with repetition again:\n\nC(n+r-1, r-1) = C(98+2-1, 2-1) = C(99, 1) = 100\n\nThis gives us the number of possible solutions that correspond to different ordered triples.\n\nNow, let's multiply this result by the total number of different ordered triples:\n\n9800000 × 100 = \\boxed{980000000}\n\nSo, there are 980,000,000 different ordered triples (a, b, c) of non-negative integers such that a + b + c = 99.",

      "question": "Each of the faces of a cube is painted by a different color. How many of the colorings are distinct up to rotations?",
      "infer_answer": "Let's break this problem down step by step!\n\n1. We have 6 faces on a cube, and each face can be painted with one of 6 different colors (let's call them A-F). So, initially, we have 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720 possible colorings.\n2. However, this number includes many duplicate colorings that are just rotations of each other. For example, if the top face is painted A, then the right face can be painted B, and the front face C, etc. This would give us one coloring. But if we rotate the cube by 90 degrees around its vertical axis, the same faces would still have the same colors (A on top, B on right, C on front, etc.). So, this is just one distinct coloring.\n3. Similarly, there are many other rotations that would produce duplicate colorings. For instance, rotating the cube by 180 degrees around its horizontal axis would also give us the same coloring as before. And so on...\n4. To account for all these rotations, we need to divide our initial count of 720 possible colorings by the number of distinct rotations.\n\nNow, let's think about how many rotations there are:\n\n* Rotating the cube by 0 degrees (no rotation) is one possibility.\n* Rotating it by 90 degrees around its vertical axis gives us another possibility.\n* Rotating it by 180 degrees around its horizontal axis gives us a third possibility.\n* Rotating it by 270 degrees around its vertical axis gives us a fourth possibility.\n\nNotice that these rotations are all equivalent, and we can't get any new colorings by combining them.

      "infer_answer": "Let's break this problem down step by step!\n\nStep 1: Consider the number of ways to arrange the digits in a string of length 5. Since there are 10 possible digits, we can use permutations with repetition:\n\n$$\\frac{10!}{5!} = 10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 = 30240$$\n\nStep 2: Now, let's count the number of strings that have strictly increasing digits. For example, \"01234\" is one such string. To find this number, we can think of it as arranging the digits in a sequence:\n\n1. First digit: any of the 10 possibilities\n2. Second digit: must be greater than the first digit (9 possibilities)\n3. Third digit: must be greater than the second digit (8 possibilities)\n4. Fourth digit: must be greater than the third digit (7 possibilities)\n5. Fifth digit: must be greater than the fourth digit (6 possibilities)\n\nUsing this reasoning, we get:\n\n$$10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 = 30240$$\n\nStep 3: Now, let's count the number of strings that have strictly decreasing digits. This is similar to Step 2, but with the opposite condition:\n\n1. First digit: any of the 10 possibilities\n2. Second digit: must be less than the first digit (9 possibilities)\n3. Third digit: must be less than the second digit (8 possibilities)\n4. Fourth digit: must be less than the third digit (7 possibilities)\n5.

We've already counted the total number of possible strings in Step 1, so we subtract the sum from that:\n\n$$30240 - (30240 + 720) = \\boxed{20160}$$\n\nTherefore, there are 20160 strings using the digits {0, 1, ..., 9} with strictly increasing or decreasing digits.",

This means we can have at most one 1 in each string.\n\n**Step 2: Count the possible ways to arrange the first digit (1 or not 1)**\nWe have two options for the first digit:\n\n* It's a 1 (let's call this case \"A\"). In this case, we have 3 choices for the second digit.\n* It's not a 1 (let's call this case \"B\"). In this case, we have 3 choices for the first digit.\n\nSo, we have two possible ways to start our string:\n\n* Case A: 1 followed by 3 possibilities\n* Case B: Not 1 followed by 3 possibilities\n\n**Step 3: Count the possible ways to arrange the remaining digits**\nOnce we've chosen the starting digit (either a 1 or not), we have 4 choices for each of the remaining 4 digits. This is because we can't choose another 1 if we started with a 1, so we effectively have only 2 options (2 or 3) for each of those positions.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the possibilities**\nWe multiply the number of ways to start the string (2 cases) by the number of ways to arrange the remaining digits (4 choices × 4 choices × 4 choices × 4 choices):\n\n* Case A: 1 followed by 3 possibilities × 4 choices × 4 choices × 4 choices = 144\n* Case B: Not 1 followed by 3 possibilities × 4 choices × 4 choices × 4 choices = 144\n\n**Step 5: Add the cases and simplify**\nWe add the two cases together:\n\n144 + 144 = 288\n\nHowever, we've overcounted because we counted each string twice (once for Case A and once for Case B).

For a convex polygon of n vertices, we draw all possible diagonals and suppose that no three diagonals pass through the same point. How many such intersection points do we have in the interior of the polygon, as an expression of n?",
      "infer_answer": "Let's break this problem down step by step.\n\n1. A diagonal connects two non-adjacent vertices. This means that for each vertex, there are 2 choices for the other vertex (since it can't be the adjacent one). So, the total number of diagonals is $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\n2. Since no three diagonals pass through the same point, we know that each intersection point is formed by exactly 3 diagonals (because if more than 3 diagonals passed through a point, at least 4 would be needed to form an intersection).\n3. Each vertex has degree $n-3$ (since it's connected to all other vertices except its two adjacent ones). This means that each vertex is the endpoint of $n-3$ diagonals.\n4. Since there are $n$ vertices, we can count the total number of endpoints by multiplying $(n-3)$ by $n$: $n(n-3) = n^2 - 3n$.\n5. However, this overcounts by a factor of 2 because each diagonal has two endpoints. So, we need to divide by 2: $\\frac{n^2 - 3n}{2}$.\n6. Now, we subtract the number of intersection points formed by the diagonals themselves (since these are not interior points). Each diagonal forms an intersection point with exactly one other diagonal. There are $\\binom{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}{2} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}-1\\right)}{2}$ such intersections.\n7.

When we expand (x+y+z)^1999, we can use the Binomial Theorem:\n\n(x+y+z)^1999 = Σ(C(1999,n) \\* x^(1999-n) \\* y^n \\* z^(1999-2n))\n\nwhere C(1999,n) is the binomial coefficient.\n\n2. Since there are 3 variables (x, y, and z), we need to consider all possible combinations of these variables in each term. This means we'll have terms with:\n\na. Only x's\nb. Only y's\nc. Only z's\nd. Some combination of x's, y's, and/or z's\n\n3. For each term, the exponent on x will range from 0 to 1999 (since there are 1999 \"x\"s in total).

      "infer_answer": "Let's break this problem down step by step:\n\n1. We have 8 dogs and 3 cookies. Each dog can get either 0, 1, or 2 cookies (since no two dogs share the same cookie).\n2. The number of ways a single dog can get cookies is: \n\t* 0 cookies: 1 way\n\t* 1 cookie: 3 ways (the dog gets any one of the 3 cookies)\n\t* 2 cookies: 1 way (the dog gets both remaining cookies, since no two dogs share the same cookie)\n3. Since each of the 8 dogs can get cookies in these 3 ways, we multiply the number of ways for a single dog by 8 to get the total number of ways for all dogs:\n\t* 0 cookies: 1 way × 8 = 8 ways\n\t* 1 cookie: 3 ways × 8 = 24 ways\n\t* 2 cookies: 1 way × 8 = 8 ways\n4. However, we need to consider that the order of dogs getting cookies matters. For example, dog A gets 2 cookies and dog B gets 1 cookie is a different result from dog B getting 2 cookies and dog A getting 1 cookie.\n5. To account for this, we multiply the total number of ways by the number of permutations of 8 dogs:\n\t* Total number of ways: 8 (0 cookies) + 24 (1 cookie) + 8 (2 cookies) = 40\n\t* Permutations of 8 dogs: 8!

Since we're only considering positive integer terms, the maximum value of any term is n-1 (since 0 is not included).\n\nNow, let's consider a specific sequence: {k+1, k+2, ..., k+m}, where m is some positive integer. The sum of this sequence is:\n\n(k+1) + (k+2) + ... + (k+m) = mk + (1 + 2 + ... + m)\n\nWe know that the sum of this sequence must be equal to n, so we can set up the equation:\n\nmk + (1 + 2 + ... + m) = n\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nm(k+1) = n - (1 + 2 + ... + m)\n\nNow, let's analyze what happens when k appears in a sequence. When k is included in the sequence, it contributes to the sum. However, when k+1 appears, it also contributes to the sum.

There are four boys and six girls, so there are a total of 10 children.\n\nNow, let's consider two cases:\n\n**Case 1:** We selected exactly 2 boys.\n\nIn this case, we have already counted the number of ways to select 2 boys: 6.\n\n**Case 2:** We selected more than 2 boys (i.e., all 4 boys).\n\nIn this case, there is only one way to select all 4 boys.\n\n5. Since we are counting the total number of ways to ensure at least 2 boys are selected, we add the number of ways in both cases: 6 (Case 1) + 1 (Case 2) = 7.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{7}",

We can fill it with either 2x1 or 2x2 tiles.\n\nFor the first column, we have two options: 2x1 tile or no tile (since the width is only 2). For the second column, we also have two options: 2x1 tile or no tile. Since both columns are independent, we can multiply the number of options for each column to get the total number of ways to fill the top row:\n\n2 options (2x1 or no tile) × 2 options (2x1 or no tile) = 4\n\nNow, let's move on to the second row. We have the same situation as before: we can fill it with either 2x1 or 2x2 tiles.\n\nFor the first column, we have two options again: 2x1 tile or no tile. For the second column, we also have two options: 2x1 tile or no tile. Since both columns are independent, we can multiply the number of options for each column to get the total number of ways to fill the second row:\n\n2 options (2x1 or no tile) × 2 options (2x1 or no tile) = 4\n\nNow that we have the number of ways to fill each row, we need to consider how these rows are connected. Since we're filling a rectangle, the top row and the second row must be connected in some way.\n\nLet's think about it: if we place a 2x1 tile in the first column of the top row, we can't place a 2x2 tile in that same column in the second row (since the width is only 2). Similarly, if we place a 2x2 tile in the first column of the top row, we can't place a 2x1 tile in that same column in the second row.\n\nThis means that for each way to fill the top row, there's only one corresponding way to fill the second row. So, we multiply the number of ways to fill the top row by the number of ways to fill the second row:\n\n4 (ways to fill top row) × 1 (way to fill second row) = 4\n\nNow, let's combine this with our initial answer for the top row:\n\n4 (ways to fill top row) × 4 (ways to fill second row) = 16\n\nSo, there are \\boxed{16} ways to fill a 2x7 rectangle with 2x1 and 2x2 tiles.",

We can start by analyzing the behavior of the function at the endpoints of the interval:\n\n- At x = 0, sin(x) = 0, cos(x) = 1, so the expression evaluates to 0.\n- At x = π/2, sin(x) = 1, cos(x) = 0, so the expression is undefined.\n\nSince the function is not defined at one of the endpoints and has a finite value at the other endpoint, we can focus on the interior of the interval [0, π/2).\n\n2. The expression involves both sine and cosine terms, which are periodic functions with period 2π. However, since we're only interested in the interval [0, π/2), we can simplify the analysis by considering the behavior of the function within this interval.\n\n3. Observe that sin(x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ [0, π/2). This is because sine is an increasing function on this interval. Similarly, cos(x) ≤ 1 for all x ∈ [0, π/2), since cosine is a decreasing function on this interval.\n\n4. Now, let's analyze the expression sin(x)^3/cos(x) + cos(x)^3/sin(x).

Rearrange the expression to make it more manageable:\n`(a - b)(b - c)(c - a) + abc - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)`\n\n3.

Each term is a fraction with a denominator that increases by 1 as n increases. Therefore, the sum of these terms will be maximized when the denominators are minimized.\n\nWhen n = 100, the smallest possible value of each term is approximately:\n\n1/(2n) ≈ 0.5\n\nSince there are 200 terms in S (from n+1 to 2n), we can approximate the maximum value of S as:\n\nS ≈ 200 × 0.5 ≈ 100\n\nThis means that when n = 400, the sum of the terms in S is approximately 100.\n\nTherefore, for values of n in {101, ..., 400}, the sum of the terms in S will be less than 3/4.\n\nStep 6: Count the remaining values of n\n\nWe still need to count the number of values of n in {401, ..., 1000} that satisfy the inequality. Since each term in S is a fraction with a denominator that increases by 1 as n increases, we know that the sum of these terms will decrease as n increases.\n\nTherefore, for values of n in {401, ..., 1000}, the sum of the terms in S will be even smaller than when n = 400. Since we've already shown that S ≈ 100 when n = 400, we can conclude that:\n\nS < 3/4\n\nfor all values of n in {401, ..., 1000}.\n\nStep 7: Combine the results\n\nWe've counted the number of values of n in {101, ..., 400} that satisfy the inequality (approximately 300) and shown that S < 3/4 for all values of n in {401, ..., 1000}. Therefore, the total number of values of n in {101, ..., 1000} that satisfy the inequality is:\n\n300 + 600 = 900\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{900}",

In fact, we can show that (n+1)^n ≥ 2^n * n! for n = 1.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when n increases. As n grows, the left-hand side grows much faster than the right-hand side. This is because the term (n+1)^n has a factor of (n+1), which dominates as n gets large. On the other hand, the right-hand side only grows linearly with n.\n\nIn particular, we can show that for n ≥ 4, (n+1)^n > 2^n * n!.

Let's factor it:\nx(x+1) = x^2 + x = (x+1/2)^2 - 1/4\n3. Since the equation is an equality, we can set both sides equal to each other:\n(x+1/2)^2 - 1/4 = y^z\n4. Now, let's focus on the right-hand side of the equation: y^z. Since z > 1, this means that y must be a perfect power (i.e., there exists an integer k such that y = p^k for some prime p).\n5. Let's assume that y is not equal to 1 (since we're looking for integer solutions). Then, we can rewrite the equation as:\n(x+1/2)^2 - 1/4 = p^k\n6. Notice that the left-hand side of the equation is a perfect square minus a constant. This means that it must be an integer. Therefore, p^k must also be an integer.\n7. Since k > 0 and y > 0, we know that k ≥ 1. This implies that p^k ≥ 2.\n8. Now, let's consider the possible values of x+1/2:\nx+1/2 = ±√(p^k + 1/4)\n9. Since x is an integer, we know that x+1/2 must be an integer as well. This means that p^k + 1/4 must be a perfect square.\n10. Let's assume that p^k + 1/4 = n^2 for some integer n. Then:\nx+1/2 = ±n\n11. Since x > 0, we know that x+1/2 ≥ 1/2. This implies that n ≤ 1.\n12. Therefore, the only possible value of x is x = 0 or x = 1.\n\nNow, let's check these values:\n* If x = 0, then y^z = 1, which means that y must be equal to 1. However, this would mean that z = 1, which contradicts the condition z > 1.\n* If x = 1, then y^z = 2, which implies that y = 2 and z = 2.\n\nSo, the only integer solution is:\n\n\\boxed{(x,y,z) = (1,2,2)}\n\nNote that there are no other solutions for x > 0, y > 0, and z > 1.",

      "infer_answer": "Let's break this problem down step by step!\n\nSince x, y, and z are integers, we know that their squares (x^2, y^2, and z^2) will also be integers.\n\nThe equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2 is a Pythagorean equation, which means that the sum of the squares of two numbers (x and y) equals the square of another number (z).\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values of z. Since z is an integer, it must be odd or even.\n\nIf z is even, then x^2 + y^2 = z^2 implies that either x or y (or both) must also be even. This is because the sum of two squares can only be even if at least one of the terms is even.\n\nOn the other hand, if z is odd, then x^2 + y^2 = z^2 implies that both x and y must be odd. This is because the sum of two odd numbers can only equal an odd number.\n\nNow, let's think about what happens when we consider the possible values of x and y modulo 5 (i.e., their remainders when divided by 5).\n\nIf x or y is divisible by 5, then its square (x^2 or y^2) will also be divisible by 25. This means that z^2 = x^2 + y^2 must be congruent to 0 modulo 25.\n\nHowever, if neither x nor y is divisible by 5, then their squares will not be divisible by 25. In this case, the only way for z^2 to be congruent to 0 modulo 25 is for z itself to be divisible by 5 (since z^2 = x^2 + y^2).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that at least one of the three numbers (x, y, or z) must be divisible by 5.\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{1}",

When we remove the first digit, it becomes x/10 (since we're dividing by 10 to get rid of the first digit).\n\nWe know that x/10 = x/57 (since it becomes 57 times smaller when its first digit is removed). This means that:\n\nx/10 = x/57\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply:\n\n10x = 57x\n\nSubtracting 57x from both sides gives us:\n\n-47x = 0\n\nDividing both sides by -47 gives us:\n\nx = 0 (since dividing by zero is undefined)\n\nHowever, the question asks for a positive integer.

When the first digit is removed, the remaining (n-1) digits are left.\n\nWe know that the original number is x, and when the first digit is removed, it becomes x/10.

This means that the number has an even number of digits, which is 4.\n\nLet's assume the value of aa (and bb) is some integer k. Then, the number can be written as:\n\nk * 100 + k = k * 101\n\nSince this is a perfect square, we know that:\n\nk^2 * 101 = x^2\n\nNow, let's factor out k^2 from both sides:\n\nk^2 * (101) = x^2\n\nTo make things simpler, let's replace k^2 with some new variable, say y. Then, the equation becomes:\n\ny * 101 = x^2\n\nSince 101 is a prime number, it cannot be factored into smaller numbers. Therefore, we can conclude that:\n\nx = √(y * 101)\n\nNow, let's find the smallest value of y that makes this expression a perfect square.\n\nWe know that:\n\ny * 101 = (some integer)^2\n\nThe smallest possible value for y is 1, which would make the equation:\n\n1 * 101 = 101\n\nHowever, 101 is not a perfect square. Let's try the next smallest value of y, which is 4:\n\n4 * 101 = 404\n\nThis is still not a perfect square.\n\nLet's try the next smallest value of y, which is 9:\n\n9 * 101 = 909\n\nAh-ha! This looks like it might be a perfect square. Let's check:\n\n√(9 * 101) = √(909)\n\n909 = (30)^2\n\nYes! We have found a perfect square that can be written as aabb: 909.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{909}",

      "infer_answer": "A nice algebraic equation!\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Start by factoring the left-hand side of the equation:\n\nx^2 - 3y^2 = (x + √3y)(x - √3y) = 17\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in two variables, x and y.\n\n2. Notice that one of the factors has a square root of 3y, which suggests that we might be able to eliminate y by squaring both sides of the equation. Let's do that:\n\n(x + √3y)(x - √3y) = 17\n\nSquaring both sides gives us:\n\n(x^2 - 3y^2) + 2x√3y = 17\n\nNow, we can equate the coefficients of y^2 on both sides:\n\n-3y^2 = -17 (since x^2 and 2x√3y have no y^2 terms)\n\nDivide by -3 to get:\n\ny^2 = 17/3\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\ny = ±√(17/3) = ±√5.67 (approximately)\n\nNow we have expressed y in terms of itself, so we can substitute this back into the original equation:\n\n(x + √3y)(x - √3y) = 17\n\nSubstitute y with ±√(17/3):\n\n(x + √3(±√(17/3)))(x - √3(±√(17/3))) = 17\n\nSimplify and combine like terms:\n\n(x + ±2.5√3)(x - ±2.5√3) = 17\n\nThis is where things get interesting! We can use the fact that (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 to simplify further:\n\n((x + ±2.5√3)^2) - (3(±2.5√3)^2) = 17\n\nSimplify and combine like terms again:\n\n(x^2 + 5.625 - 11.25) = 17\n\nCombine the constant terms:\n\nx^2 - 5.625 = 17\n\nAdd 5.625 to both sides:\n\nx^2 = 22.625\n\nTake the square root of both sides (remember, x is an integer!):\n\nx = ±√(22.625) ≈ ±4.73 or ±5.23\n\nSince x must be an integer, we can round these values to get our final answers:\n\nx = ±5\n\nSo, the integer solutions to the equation are:\n\nx = 5 and x = -5\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\boxed{x = \\pm 5}",

      "infer_answer": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. We are looking for all possible values of `n^5 - 5n^3 + 4n` modulo 120.\n2. Since we're dealing with modular arithmetic, we can simplify the expression by factoring out `n`:\n\t* `n^5 - 5n^3 + 4n = n(n^4 - 5n^2 + 4)`\n3. Now, let's analyze the quadratic part of the expression: `n^4 - 5n^2 + 4`. We can rewrite it as:\n\t* `(n^2 - 1)(n^2 - 4) = (n-1)(n+1)(n^2 - 4)`\n4. Since `n` is an integer, we know that `(n-1)` and `(n+1)` are either both even or both odd. This means that their product, `(n^2 - 4)`, is also even.\n5. Now, let's consider the possible values of `n^2 - 4`. Since it's an integer, we know that:\n\t* If `n` is even, then `n^2 - 4` is a multiple of 4 (because `n^2` is a multiple of 4 and `-4` is also a multiple of 4).\n\t* If `n` is odd, then `n^2 - 4` is either 1 or 3 (mod 4), because `(n-1)^2 = n^2 - 2n + 1` and `(n+1)^2 = n^2 + 2n + 1`, both of which are congruent to 1 or 3 mod 4.\n6. Now, let's combine these observations with the fact that `n(n^4 - 5n^2 + 4)` is equivalent to `(n-1)(n+1)(n^2 - 4)` modulo 120:\n\t* If `n` is even, then `n^2 - 4` is a multiple of 4, which means that `(n-1)(n+1)(n^2 - 4)` is equivalent to 0 (mod 120), because the product of three consecutive integers is always divisible by 3.\n\t* If `n` is odd, then `n^2 - 4` is either 1 or 3 (mod 4). In this case, `(n-1)(n+1)(n^2 - 4)` is equivalent to either 1 or 3 (mod 120), because the product of three consecutive integers and a multiple of 4 is always congruent to 0, 1, or 3 mod 120.\n\nSo, we have found that:\n\n* If `n` is even, then `n^5 - 5n^3 + 4n` is equivalent to 0 (mod 120).\n* If `n` is odd, then `n^5 - 5n^3 + 4n` is equivalent to either 1 or 3 (mod 120).\n\nIn summary, the possible values of `n^5 - 5n^3 + 4n` modulo 120 are:\n\n$$\\boxed{\\{0, 1, 3\\}}$$",

By the Freshman's Dream, we have that $a^5 + b^5 + c^5 + d^5 + e^5 \\equiv (a+b+c+d+e)^5 \\pmod{5^2}$.\n4.

First, let's factor out a common factor from both sides of the equation:\n\n19x^3 - 84y^2 = 1984\n19(x^3 - 4y^2) = 1984\n\nThis doesn't simplify much, but it's a good starting point.\n\n2. Now, let's look at the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation: 1984. This is equal to 2 × 992, which might be useful later on.\n\n3. Next, let's focus on the left-hand side (LHS). We have:\n\n19(x^3 - 4y^2)\n\nNotice that both x and y are integers. Since 19 is a prime number, it must divide one of the terms inside the parentheses. Let's assume wlog (without loss of generality) that 19 divides x^3 - 4y^2.\n\n4. Now, let's rewrite the equation:\n\n19(x^3 - 4y^2) = 1984\nx^3 - 4y^2 = 104\n\nSince 19 divides x^3 - 4y^2, we can write:\n\nx^3 - 4y^2 = 19k for some integer k\n\n5.

Since x is an integer, we can factor out a perfect square from x^3:\n\nx^3 = (x)^2 × x\nx^3 = y^2 × x\n\n9. Equating the two expressions for x^3, we get:\n\ny^2 × x = 95\n\n10.

      "infer_answer": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. We are given the expression n^2 - 19n + 89, which we want to factor into the product of two binomials:\n\nn^2 - 19n + 89 = (n - a)(n - b)\n\nwhere a and b are constants.\n\n2. To factor the expression, we can start by finding two numbers whose product is 89 and whose sum is -19. These numbers are -1 and -89, since (-1) × (-89) = 89 and (-1) + (-89) = -90 (which is close to -19).\n\n3. Now, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\nn^2 - 19n + 89 = (n - 1)(n - 89)\n\n4. Since the expression is a perfect square, it must be equal to the square of some number x:\n\nx^2 = (n - 1)(n - 89)\n\n5. To find all possible values of n, we can expand the right-hand side and set it equal to x^2:\n\nx^2 = n^2 - 90n + 88\n\n6. Now, we can complete the square on the right-hand side:\n\nx^2 = (n - 45)^2 - 722\n\n7. Since the left-hand side is a perfect square, the right-hand side must also be a perfect square. This means that the constant term (-722) must be a perfect square.\n\n8. The only perfect squares close to -722 are -721 and -723. However, we can rule out -723 since it would make n too small (n < 11).\n\n9. Therefore, we have:\n\n-721 = (n - 45)^2\n\n10. Taking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n√(-721) = ±(n - 45)\n\n11. Simplifying, we get:\n\n±√(-721) = ±(n - 45)\n\n12.

However, since √(-721) is an imaginary number (i.e., it's not a real number), this means that there are no real values of n that satisfy the condition.\n\n15.

      "infer_answer": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Since we're only appending digits from 0 to 8, each term in the sequence will be a single-digit integer.\n2. A composite number is an integer that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself. In particular, it must have at least one even factor (since 2 is always a factor).\n3. Since we're only appending digits from 0 to 8, the only way for a term in the sequence to be even is if the last digit appended was 0 or 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n4. Now, consider the case where the last digit appended is 0. In this case, the resulting number will be an integer multiple of 10 (since it ends with a 0). This means that the number will be divisible by at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself (namely, 10).\n5. Similarly, if the last digit appended is 2, 4, 6, or 8, the resulting number will also be even, and thus composite.\n6. However, there's a crucial observation to make: if the last digit appended is 0, then the resulting number will always be divisible by 10, which means it will have at least one even factor (namely, 2). This implies that every term in the sequence that ends with a 0 will be composite.\n7. On the other hand, if the last digit appended is not 0, then the resulting number will be odd, and thus not composite.\n8. Since we can always append at least one more digit to create an even number (by appending 0), it's impossible to get stuck in a cycle of only odd numbers.\n9.

However, as n grows, the largest prime factor of P will be approximately n-1 (by the prime number theorem).\n\nSo, we can conclude that:\n\nP = (n-1)! has many small prime factors, but its largest prime factor is roughly n-1\n\nNow, let's go back to S. We know that S = (n-1)((n/2) - 1) + 1. Since S is a factor of P, we can write:\n\nS = k*(n-1)! for some integer k\n\nNow, let's analyze the factors of S. Since S is a sum of integers up to n-1, its largest prime factor will be roughly (n-1)/2 (by the prime number theorem).\n\nHowever, since S has many small prime factors (like 2 and 3), we can conclude that:\n\nS = k*(n-1)! has many small prime factors, but its largest prime factor is roughly (n-1)/2\n\nNow, let's compare the largest prime factors of P and S. We know that P's largest prime factor is roughly n-1, while S's largest prime factor is roughly (n-1)/2.\n\nSince n > 2, we can conclude that:\n\n(n-1) > (n-1)/2\n\nThis means that the largest prime factor of P (roughly n-1) is greater than the largest prime factor of S (roughly (n-1)/2).\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of k. Since S = k*(n-1)! has many small prime factors and its largest prime factor is roughly (n-1)/2, we can conclude that:\n\nk < (n-1)/2\n\nThis means that k must be a relatively small integer.\n\nFinally, let's combine our findings. We know that n > 2, S = k*(n-1)!, P = (n-1)!, and k is a relatively small integer.\n\nNow, we can try to find all prime numbers n > 2 such that S is a factor of P. Since S has many small prime factors and its largest prime factor is roughly (n-1)/2, we can conclude that:\n\nS = k*(n-1)! for some small integer k\n\nThe only way this can happen is if k = 1 or k = 2.\n\nIf k = 1, then S = (n-1)!. This means that the sum of integers up to n-1 is equal to the factorial of n-1. However, this is impossible for n > 3, since the sum of integers up to n-1 grows much faster than the factorial of n-1.\n\nIf k = 2, then S = 2*(n-1)!. This means that the double sum of integers up to n-1 (i.e., 1 + 2 + ... + (n-2) + (n-1)) is equal to the product of the first n-1 odd numbers.\n\nThis happens precisely when n is a prime number greater than 3. The only such primes are:\n\n* n = 5\n* n = 7\n\nSo, our final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{n=5 \\text{ or } n=7}",

This means that $20^n=(20^2)^{k} = 400^k$ and $16^n=(16)^{2k}=256^k$.\n2. Now, let's focus on the expression $20^n+16^n-3^n-1 \\pmod{323}$. We can rewrite it as:\n\n$$400^k + 256^k - 3^n - 1 \\pmod{323}$$\n\nSince $400\\equiv 77\\pmod{323}$ and $256\\equiv 59\\pmod{323}$, we can simplify the expression further:\n\n$$77^k+59^k-3^n-1 \\pmod{323}$$\n3. Observe that $77$ and $59$ are relatively prime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is $1$). This means that Fermat's Little Theorem applies, which states that if $a$ and $n$ are coprime, then:\n\n$$a^{n-1}\\equiv 1\\pmod{n}$$\n\nIn our case, we have $a=77$ and $n=k$.

The digit sum of a number is the sum of its individual digits. For example, the digit sum of 123 is 1+2+3=6.\n3. Let's consider a perfect square $n^2$. Its digit sum can be written as $\\sigma(n^2)$, where $\\sigma$ denotes the digit sum function.\n\nOur goal is to determine if there exists an integer $n$ such that $\\sigma(n^2)=1977$.\n\n4. Since 1977 has six digits (1,9,7,7), we can start by considering perfect squares with at most six digits.\n5. The largest perfect square with five digits is 31625 ($15^2$). Let's check the digit sum of this number: $\\sigma(31625)=3+1+6+2+5=17$. This is not equal to 1977, so we can rule out perfect squares with five or fewer digits.\n6. Now, let's consider perfect squares with six digits. The largest one is $10^2=100$, which has a digit sum of $\\sigma(100)=1+0+0=1$. This is not equal to 1977 either.\n7. We can continue this process for larger perfect squares, but it's clear that the digit sum will always be less than or equal to the number itself (since each digit contributes at most one unit to the sum). Therefore, we need a perfect square with many digits to have a digit sum close to 1977.\n8. However, as we increase the number of digits in the perfect square, its value grows exponentially. For example, $20^2=400$, $30^2=900$, and so on. This means that the digit sum will also grow rapidly, making it even more unlikely for it to equal 1977.\n9. In conclusion, after exhaustively considering perfect squares with various numbers of digits, we have not found a single integer $n$ such that $\\sigma(n^2)=1977$.

Start by simplifying the right-hand side of the equation:\n\nx^2 + xy + y^2 + 1 = (x + y)^2 + 1\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nx^3 + x^2*y + x*y^2 + y^3 = 8((x+y)^2 + 1)\n\n2. Notice that the left-hand side is a sum of three cubes, which can be factored as:\n\n(x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2) + y^3\n\nUsing this factorization, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2) + y^3 = 8((x+y)^2 + 1)\n\n3. Now, let's try to find a common factor between the two sides of the equation. We can start by factoring out (x+y) from both sides:\n\n(x+y)((x-y)^2 + 3xy + y^2) = 8((x+y)^2 + 1)\n\n4. Notice that the left-hand side is now a product of two expressions, each of which is equal to 0 or 1 when x+y=0. This suggests that we might be able to find an integer solution by setting x+y=0 and solving for x and y.\n\n5. If x+y=0, then:\n\nx^2 + xy + y^2 = -y^2\n\nSubstituting this into the original equation, we get:\n\n-x^3 - x^2*y - y^3 = 8(-y^2 + 1)\n\nSimplifying and rearranging, we find that:\n\n(x+y)(-x^2 + xy + y^2) = 0\n\nThis is true if either (x+y)=0 or (-x^2 + xy + y^2)=0. Since x+y=0, the only remaining possibility is:\n\n-x^2 + xy + y^2 = 0\n\n6. This equation can be factored as:\n\n-(x-y)^2 + 3xy = 0\n\nSimplifying and rearranging again, we find that:\n\n(x-y)(-x-y) = 0\n\nThis is true if either (x-y)=0 or (-x-y)=0. Since x+y=0, the only remaining possibility is:\n\nx-y = 0\n\n7.

      "infer_answer": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. We are given two equations: x^5 + y^5 = 33 and x + y = 3.\n2. Notice that both equations involve only integers (x and y). This means that we can focus on finding integer solutions to these equations.\n3. Start by analyzing the second equation, x + y = 3. Since both variables are integers, we know that at least one of them must be even and the other odd (or vice versa).\n4. Let's assume w.l.o.g. that x is even. Then, since x + y = 3, we have y = 3 - x.\n5. Substitute this expression for y into the first equation: x^5 + (3 - x)^5 = 33.\n6. Expand and simplify the left-hand side:\n\nx^5 + (3 - x)^5 = x^5 + 243 - 15x + 10x^4 - 30x^3 + 20x^2 - 6x + 1\n= 10x^4 - 30x^3 + 20x^2 - 6x + 242\n\n7. Set this expression equal to 33 and solve for x:\n\n10x^4 - 30x^3 + 20x^2 - 6x + 209 = 0\n8. Factor the polynomial (using rational roots theorem or other methods):\n\n(5x - 1)(2x - 7)(x + 1)(x - 13) = 0\n\n9. Solve for x:\n\nx = 1/5, 7/2, -1, or 13\n10. Since we are looking for integer solutions, discard the non-integer values (1/5 and 7/2).\n11. For each of the remaining three values of x (-1 and 13), calculate the corresponding value of y using the second equation:\n\nx = -1: y = 4\nx = 13: y = -10\n\n12.

      "infer_answer": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The polynomial x^2 - 6x + 1 has roots x_1 and x_2.\n2. Since it's a quadratic equation, we can factor it as (x - x_1)(x - x_2) = x^2 - 6x + 1.\n3. Expanding the right-hand side, we get: x^2 - (x_1 + x_2)x + x_1x_2 = x^2 - 6x + 1.\n4. Equating the coefficients of x^2 on both sides, we get: 1 = 1. This is true, so we can move forward.\n5. Equating the coefficients of x on both sides, we get: -(x_1 + x_2) = -6. Therefore, x_1 + x_2 = 6.\n6. Since x_1 and x_2 are roots, they must satisfy the equation x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0. Let's substitute x_1 for x in this equation: x_1^2 - 6x_1 + 1 = 0.\n7. Simplifying the equation, we get: (x_1 - 3)^2 = 8. Taking the square root of both sides, we get: |x_1 - 3| = ±√8.\n8. Since x_1 is a real number, it must be that |x_1 - 3| = √8. Therefore, x_1 = 3 ± √8.\n9. Similarly, we can find the value of x_2: x_2 = 3 ∓ √8.\n10. Now, let's consider the expression x_1^n + x_2^n for some integer n. We want to know when this expression divided by 5 gives a remainder of 4.\n\nNotice that both x_1 and x_2 are irrational numbers. However, we can simplify the expression by noticing that:\n\nx_1^n + x_2^n = (3 ± √8)^n + (3 ∓ √8)^n\n\nUsing the fact that (√8)^n is an integer multiple of 4 (since 8 is a power of 2), we can rewrite the expression as:\n\nx_1^n + x_2^n = (3 ± k√8) + (3 ∓ k√8)\n\nwhere k is some integer.\n\n11. Simplifying further, we get: x_1^n + x_2^n = 6 ± 2k√8.\n12. Now, let's consider the remainder when this expression is divided by 5. Since √8 is irrational, it cannot be expressed as a multiple of 5. Therefore, the remainder will always be 0 or 4 (since 1 and 3 are not possible remainders).\n\n13. To get a remainder of 4, we need: x_1^n + x_2^n ≡ 4 (mod 5).\n14. Simplifying this congruence, we get: 6 ± 2k√8 ≡ 4 (mod 5).\n\nNotice that the term 6 is already congruent to 1 modulo 5, so we can ignore it.\n\n15. The only way for 2k√8 ≡ 3 (mod 5) is if k = 3. This means that x_1^n + x_2^n ≡ 4 (mod 5) when n = 3 or n = 117 (since these are the only values of n that make k = 3).\n\n16.

This means that the graph of $y=f(x)$ does not intersect the line $y=x$ at all.\n3. Now, consider the function $g(x) = f(f(x))$. We want to find the maximum number of real solutions for this equation: $g(x) = x$.\n4. Since $f(x) = x$ has no real solutions, we know that $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing or decreasing function (otherwise, it would have at least one solution).\n5. This means that the graph of $y=f(x)$ is either always above or always below the line $y=x$. Let's assume it's always above; the other case will follow similarly.\n6. Since $g(x) = f(f(x))$, we know that the graph of $y=g(x)$ is the composition of the graph of $y=f(x)$ with itself. This means that the graph of $y=g(x)$ is the graph of $y=f(x)$ reflected across the line $y=x$.\n7. Since the graph of $y=f(x)$ is always above the line $y=x$, the graph of $y=g(x)$ will be always below the line $y=x$. This means that the equation $g(x) = x$ has at most one solution, which is the point where the graphs intersect.\n8. However, we can have multiple solutions if the graph of $y=f(x)$ intersects itself at some point. In this case, the graph of $y=g(x)$ will also intersect itself, and we'll get additional solutions.\n9. Since the degree of $f(x)$ is $n$, the maximum number of intersections between the graphs of $y=f(x)$ and $y=x$ (and therefore between the graphs of $y=g(x)$) is $n-1$.

Therefore, the maximum number of real solutions for the equation $g(x) = x$ is $\\boxed{n-1}$.\n\nNote that if we had assumed that the graph of $y=f(x)$ was always below the line $y=x$, the same reasoning would lead to the same conclusion: $n-1$.",

Let's consider what happens when x is very small (i.e., x ≈ 0):\n\nx^(1/4) ≈ 0, and (97 - x)^(1/4) ≈ 1\n\nSo, in this case, the left-hand side of the equation would be approximately 1, which is not equal to 5.\n\n5. Now let's consider what happens when x is very large (i.e., x ≈ 97):\n\nx^(1/4) ≈ 1, and (97 - x)^(1/4) ≈ 0\n\nAgain, the left-hand side of the equation would be approximately 1, which is not equal to 5.\n\n6. Since we've ruled out the cases where x is very small or very large, let's try to find an integer value of x that makes the equation true.\n\n7. After some trial and error, we find that when x = 81, the left-hand side of the equation equals 5:\n\nx^(1/4) + (97 - x)^(1/4) = 81^(1/4) + (16)^(1/4) = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nThis is not equal to 5, so x cannot be 81.\n\n8. After further trial and error, we find that when x = 80, the left-hand side of the equation equals 5:\n\nx^(1/4) + (97 - x)^(1/4) = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nThis is equal to 5, so x must be 80.\n\n9. To confirm our answer, let's plug x = 80 back into the original equation and simplify:\n\n(80)^(1/4) + (97 - 80)^(1/4) = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nThis is indeed true, so our final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{x=80}",

Each step S_j affects only one lamp L_j, and its effect depends on the state of the previous lamp L_(j−1).\n3. If L_(j−1) is ON, then S_j toggles the state of L_j (i.e., turns it OFF if it was ON, or vice versa). If L_(j−1) is OFF, then S_j leaves L_j unchanged.\n4. The lamps are labeled modulo n, which means that L_0 = L_n, and L_1 = L_(n+1).\n5. We want to find out how many values of n result in a sequence of switching not being able to return all lamps to the ON state ever again.\n\nLet's analyze what happens when we apply S_j:\n\n* If L_(j−1) is ON, then S_j turns L_j OFF.\n* If L_(j−1) is OFF, then S_j leaves L_j unchanged.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we apply S_0. Since all lamps are initially ON, S_0 will turn the first lamp (L_0) OFF. This means that L_0 = OFF.\n\nNext, we'll apply S_1. Since L_0 is OFF, S_1 leaves L_1 unchanged. So, L_1 remains ON.\n\nNow, let's apply S_2. Since L_1 is ON, S_2 turns L_2 OFF.\n\nNotice a pattern? When we apply S_j, the lamp L_j gets toggled if and only if the previous lamp (L_(j−1)) was ON. If the previous lamp was OFF, then L_j remains unchanged.\n\nThis means that as long as there is at least one ON lamp in the sequence, we can always toggle it to get all lamps back to the ON state. However, if all lamps are initially OFF, then no matter how many steps we take, we cannot get them all back to the ON state.\n\nSo, what values of n result in all lamps being initially OFF? Well, since there are n lamps, at least one lamp must be OFF for n ≥ 2. Therefore, only when n = 1 do we have all lamps initially ON.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is:\n\n$$\\boxed{\\text{The number of values of }n\\text{ that result in a sequence not being able to return all lamps to the ON state ever again is } \\boxed{1}.}$$",

This means that if we replace x_n with a/x_n and vice versa, the equation remains unchanged. This symmetry suggests that the sequence might have some kind of \"fixed point\" or equilibrium value.\n\nStep 2: Consider the case where x_n = k for some constant k. Substituting this into the recurrence relation, we get:\n\nk = (k + a/k) / 2\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we can simplify this to:\n\n2k = k + a/k\n\nSubtracting k from both sides gives us:\n\nk = a/(2k)\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\nk^2 = a/2\n\nThis equation has two possible solutions for k: one positive and one negative.

We can write a recursive formula:\n\n* If `n = 2`, then `a_2 = 2`.\n* For `n > 2`, we have:\n\t+ `a_n` includes all permutations where `p(n) = n`, which is the same as having `a_{n-1}` permutations.\n\t+ `a_n` also includes all permutations where `p(n) = n-1` or `p(n) = n+1`, which is the same as having `2 * a_{n-2}` permutations (since we can swap the last two elements to get another permutation).\n\nSo, we have:\n\n`a_n = a_{n-1} + 2 * a_{n-2}`\n\n**Step 6: Find the value of a_10**\nUsing the recursive formula, we can calculate `a_10`:\n\n* `a_3 = a_2 + 2 * a_1 = 2 + 2 * 2 = 6`\n* `a_4 = a_3 + 2 * a_2 = 6 + 2 * 2 = 10`\n* `a_5 = a_4 + 2 * a_3 = 10 + 2 * 6 = 22`\n* `a_6 = a_5 + 2 * a_4 = 22 + 2 * 10 = 44`\n* `a_7 = a_6 + 2 * a_5 = 44 + 2 * 22 = 108`\n* `a_8 = a_7 + 2 * a_6 = 108 + 2 * 44 = 260`\n* `a_9 = a_8 + 2 * a_7 = 260 + 2 * 108 = 584`\n* `a_{10} = a_9 + 2 * a_8 = 584 + 2 * 260 = 1144`\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n**boxed{1144}**\n\nI hope this step-by-step solution helps!",

To do this, we can start by using the given equation with m = 0 and n = 1:\n\na_(0+1) + a_(0-1) = (a_(2(0)) + a_(2(1))) / 2\na_1 + a_{-1} = (a_0 + a_2) / 2\n\nNow, we are given that a_1 = 1. We can substitute this into the equation above:\n\n1 + a_{-1} = (a_0 + a_2) / 2\n\nWe don't know what a_0 or a_2 is yet, but we can simplify the right-hand side of the equation by using the given equation again with m = 1 and n = 0. This gives us:\n\n1 + a_{-1} = ((a_(2(1)) + a_(2(0)))) / 2\n1 + a_{-1} = (a_2 + a_0) / 2\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for the right-hand side back into our original equation:\n\n1 + a_{-1} = (a_2 + a_0) / 2\n2(1 + a_{-1}) = a_2 + a_0\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n2 + 2a_{-1} = a_2 + a_0\n\nNow we can use the fact that a_1 = 1 to find a_{-1}. Since a_1 is one more than a_{-1}, we have:\n\na_{-1} = a_1 - 1\n= 1 - 1\n= 0\n\nSubstituting this back into our equation, we get:\n\n2 + 2(0) = a_2 + a_0\n2 = a_2 + a_0\n\nNow we can use the given equation again with m = 2 and n = 0 to find a_2:\n\na_(2+0) + a_(2-0) = (a_(2(2)) + a_(2(0))) / 2\na_2 + a_0 = (a_4 + a_0) / 2\n\nSubstituting our expression for a_0 from above, we get:\n\na_2 + (2-a_2) = (a_4 + 2) / 2\n3 - a_2 = (a_4 + 2) / 2\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 and simplifying, we get:\n\n6 - 2a_2 = a_4 + 2\n\nNow we can use the given equation again with m = 4 and n = 0 to find a_4:\n\na_(4+0) + a_(4-0) = (a_(2(4)) + a_(2(0))) / 2\na_4 + a_0 = (a_8 + a_0) / 2\n\nSubstituting our expression for a_0 from above, we get:\n\na_4 + (2-a_4) = (a_8 + 2) / 2\n3 - a_4 = (a_8 + 2) / 2\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 and simplifying, we get:\n\n6 - 2a_4 = a_8 + 2\n\nNow we can see that this is the same equation as before, but with a_2 replaced by a_4.

Let's start by analyzing the sequence.\n\nSince a_1 = 0, we have:\n\n* a_2 = |a_1 + 1| = |1| = 1\n* a_3 = |a_2 + 1| = |1 + 1| = |2| = 2\n* a_4 = |a_3 + 1| = |2 + 1| = |3| = 3\n\nNotice that the absolute values of the terms are increasing by 1 each time.\n\nFor even n, let's consider the smallest possible value of (a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n)/n. Since the sequence is increasing, we can assume that all terms except one are equal to the previous term plus 1. Let's say this \"exceptional\" term is a_k.\n\nThen:\n\n* a_1 = 0\n* a_2 = 1\n* ...\n* a_(k-1) = k - 1\n* a_k = exceptional value (let's call it x)\n* a_(k+1) = k + 1\n* ...\n* a_n = n - 1\n\nThe sum of the terms is:\n\na_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n = 0 + 1 + ... + (k-1) + x + (k+1) + ... + (n-1)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\na_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n = k - 1 + x + n - 1\n\nSince we want to find the smallest value of the average, we can minimize the numerator by choosing the smallest possible value for x. Since x is an exceptional term, it's likely that x will be smaller than the other terms.\n\nThe smallest possible value for x is 0 (since a_k = |a_(k-1) + 1| and a_(k-1) is positive).

Then:\n\n(a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n)/n = (k - 1)/(2m)\n\nTo minimize this expression, we need to find the smallest possible value of k.\n\nFrom the definition of the sequence, we know that |a_k| = |a_(k-1) + 1|. Since a_(k-1) is positive, this means that a_k is also positive. Therefore, k must be odd (since it's an integer).\n\nThe smallest possible value of k is 3.\n\nSubstituting k = 3 into the expression for the average, we get:\n\n(a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n)/n = (3 - 1)/(2m) = 2/(2m)\n\nSince m can be any integer, we can minimize this expression by choosing the smallest possible value of m.

The equation a_(mn) = a_m + a_n implies that the product mn can be expressed as the sum of two integers m and n.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of a_1:\n\n* If a_1 = 0, then a_(mn) = 0 for all m, n. This means that the sequence is constant at 0, which doesn't satisfy the condition that the sequence is strictly increasing.\n* If a_1 > 0, then we can consider two cases:\n\t+ Case 1: a_2 = a_1 + 1\n\t+ Case 2: a_2 ≤ a_1\n\nLet's examine each case:\n\nCase 1: a_2 = a_1 + 1\n\n* Then, a_(11) = a_1 + a_1 + 1 = 2a_1 + 1\n* Since a_(11) = a_1 + 1 (by the equation), we get 2a_1 + 1 = a_1 + 1, which implies that a_1 = 0.

This can be seen by considering the first few terms:\n\n* `a_1 = a`\n* `a_2 = b` ( midpoint between `a` and `b`)\n* `a_3 = (a_2 + a_1) / 2 = (b+a) / 2`\n* `a_4 = (a_3 + a_2) / 2 = (a+b)/2`\n\nThis symmetry suggests that the sequence might converge to `(a+b)/2`.\n\n**Step 3: Prove convergence**\n\nTo prove convergence, we can show that the sequence is monotonically decreasing and bounded.\n\n* Monotonicity: `a_(n+1) = (a_n + a_{n-1}) / 2` implies `a_(n+1) ≤ a_n` for all `n`, since `a_1 = a` and `a_2 = b`.\n* Boundedness: The sequence is bounded above by `(a+b)/2`, which is the midpoint of `a` and `b`.\n\n**Step 4: Find the limit**\n\nSince the sequence is monotonically decreasing and bounded, it converges to its least upper bound. By the symmetry observed earlier, this least upper bound must be `(a+b)/2`. Therefore, the limit exists and is:\n\n$$\\boxed{\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = \\frac{a+b}{2}}$$",

Then, `a_3=2`, which is a special case that will help us later.\n\n**Step 2: Find a pattern (or not)**\nLet's try to find a pattern in the sequence. For `n >= 3`, we have:\n\n`a_(n+3) = (a_(n+1)*a_(n+2)+5)/a_n`\n\nThis is a recursive formula, which means it depends on previous terms. Let's see if we can simplify or find a pattern.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the first few terms**\nLet's look at the first few terms:\n\n`a_1 = 1`, `a_2 = 1`, `a_3 = 2`\n`a_4 = (a_2*a_3+5)/a_1 = (1*2+5)/1 = 7/1 = 7`\n`a_5 = (a_3*a_4+5)/a_2 = (2*7+5)/1 = 19/1 = 19`\n`a_6 = (a_4*a_5+5)/a_3 = (7*19+5)/2 = 132/2 = 66`\n\nHmm, it looks like the sequence is not periodic or straightforward. However, we can notice that `a_n` seems to be increasing rapidly.\n\n**Step 4: Conjecture and prove**\nLet's make a conjecture: all terms `a_n` with `n >= 3` are integers if and only if `a_n` is odd. We'll prove this by induction.\n\nBase case (`n = 3`): `a_3 = 2`, which is even, so our conjecture holds.\n\nInductive step:\nAssume `a_k` is odd for some `k >= 3`. We need to show that `a_(k+1)` is also odd.\n\nUsing the recursive formula:\n\n`a_(k+1) = (a_k*a_(k+2)+5)/a_(k-1)`\n\nSince `a_k` is odd, `a_k*a_(k+2)` is even. Also, `a_(k-1)` is odd by assumption. Therefore, the numerator of the fraction is even, and the denominator is odd. This means `a_(k+1)` is odd.\n\nBy induction, our conjecture holds for all `n >= 3`.\n\n**Step 5: Count the integers**\nSince we've shown that all terms `a_n` with `n >= 3` are integers if and only if `a_n` is odd, we can count the number of integers in the sequence:\n\n* The first two terms (`a_1=a_2=1`) are not integers.\n* The third term (`a_3=2`) is even, so it's not an integer.\n* All subsequent terms with `n >= 4` are odd and integers.\n\nThere are 97 numbers in the sequence (100 - 3 = 97), and all but three of them are integers.

There are 99 possible values for r (since it can't be 1), and there are 100 possible values for t. This gives us 99 × 100 = 9900 possibilities for a single progression.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to select 12 progressions**\nSince each selection is independent, we multiply the number of ways to select a single progression by itself 12 times:\n\n9900 × 9900 × ...
