Research the early history of Russia: I'll focus on the period when Peter the Great (1682-1725) ruled Russia.\n\nAccording to historical records, Peter the Great was the first Russian ruler to adopt Western-style government and institutions. During his reign, he established the Senate (1711), which served as a council of state and effectively became the highest governing body in the country.\n\n4. Confirm the relevant dates: Peter the Great came into power after the death of his half-sister, Sophia Alekseyevna (1657-1704), who had ruled Russia as regent since 1682. He officially became the Emperor of All Russia on February 8, 1721.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe first prime minister equivalent in the Russian Empire was the Senate, which was established during Peter the Great's reign.
